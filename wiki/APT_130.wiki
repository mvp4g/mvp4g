#summary How to set Mvp4g APT (Draft for 1.3.0)

== Introduction ==
All the Mvp4g configuration errors are detected during GWT compilation or while launching GWT dev mode. Thanks to Mvp4g APT, you can detect most of the errors in the IDE. 

The following errors can be detected thanks to the APT:
 * Handler doesn't define the right handling method for an event.
 * Handler is not annotated with @Presenter or @EventHandler
 * Incompatible event bus is injected to an handler. 
 * Incompatible view is injected to a presenter. 
 * History Converter doesn't define the right converting method for an event.
 * Incompatible event bus is injected to an history converter.
 * History Converter is not annotated with @History.
