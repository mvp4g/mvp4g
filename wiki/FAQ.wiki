#summary Mvp4g faq

If you have other questions about the framework or would like further information about a question, just let me know by leaving a message on the FAQ discusion in the Mvp4g Google group (http://groups.google.com/group/mvp4g/browse_thread/thread/d8ee207598bf02fa).

==What's the class diagram of the framework?==
http://mvp4g.googlecode.com/svn/tags/mvp4g-1.1.0/documentation/uml/mvp4g_class_diagram_overview.png

==What's a presenter?==
In a MVP architecture, the presenter is in charge of the logic of the application. It acts upon the model and the view.<br/>
In the Mvp4g framework, a presenter is also an object that implements the PresenterInterface. 

==What's a view?==
In the MVP architecture, a view is the object that displays the data and routes user commands to the presenter to act upon that data.<br/>
In the Mvp4g framework, a view can be any type of object. The developer is free to use any widgets library he wants.

==What's a service?==
In the Mvp4g framework, a service is build thanks to GWT deferred binding (ie thanks to GWT.create method). The goal of this type of elements is to communicate with the server.

==What's an event bus and how can it dispatch events?==
The event bus is a Java object, generated by the Mvp4g library in charge of dispatching events between the presenters.<br/>
It allows presenters to communicate between each other without a direct link between them (no spaghetti effect).

==When and how are presenters, views and services instantiated? When and how views and services injected into presenters? When is the event bus created and configured?==
All these actions are done thanks to the following lines:
{{{
Mvp4gModule module = (Mvp4gModule)GWT.create( Mvp4gModule.class );
module.createAndStartModule();
RootLayoutPanel.get().add( (Widget)module.getStartView() );
}}}

The first line creates a Java class thanks to the configuration (annotations or XML) using GWT Deferred Binding feature.

The call to the createAndStartModule method will:
 * create the needed instance of views, services, presenters and history converters.
 * create the event bus.
 * injects views, services and event bus in the presenters.

Thanks to the third line, the start view of the module is added to the Root panel.

==Is Mvp4g compatible with all browsers?==

Mvp4g is 100% Java so it is guaranted to be compatible with all the browsers thanks to the GWT compiler.

==How fast is Mvp4g compared to GWT Handler Manager?==

You can look at this page [Mvp4gPerformances Mvp4g Performances] that compares Mvp4g and GWT Handler Manager. As you can see with the result, Mvp4g event bus processes events faster than GWT HandlerManager. However time to process a few events is almost equal to 0 for both event bus and in most cases applications won't send more than 1 or 2 events at a time. To sum up, you can use Mvp4g without worrying to make your application slow.
